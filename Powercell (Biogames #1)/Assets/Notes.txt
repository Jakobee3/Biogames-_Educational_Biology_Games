List of Other Prefabs 

List of Scripts
	CarbonChain- contains a number of carbons and phosphates, change numcarbons and numphosphates at runtime
	CarbonChainPlus- extended to contain a number of carbons, phosphates, oxygens, hydrogens, and electrons
	ChainChecker- spawns a number of molecules (assigned in inspector) when an object tagged MovingCarbonChain impacts its collider
		has a bool which changes to true if it has already spawned its molecules

	MoleculeViewRelay- onmouseover relays the attached molecule to molecule view, causing the view to change
	MoleculeView- when sent a molecule name from MoleculeViewRelay, moves the child object with the same name to the front of the GUI 

	Draggable- attached to movable molecules to allow them to be dragged
	PuzzleSocket- contains a socketname and socketedmolecule name
	GlycolysisController- in glycolysis- controls the production gui, spawns initial molecules, plays sounds, 
		moves and resets the MovingCarbonChain
	Target- causes the attached object to rotate around its start position
	Reaction- has input socket, output socket and enzyme- alters the MovingCarbonChain based on what is in the sockets
	
	MoleculeWobble- causes molecules to wobble slightly when they aren't being picked up 
	ExpandedView- expands and retracts the inspector assigned gameobject on mouse over and exit
	ExpandIn- causes objects to expand in from nothing when they appear
	UIShake- when public variable shake made true, shakes the attached UI 
	UIMoveScale- moves and scales an attached UI, currently unused

	SceneTransitionAndStorage- attached to the SceneTransitionAndStorage object which has DontDestroyOnLoad
		saves the scene state before the scene changes, loads the scene state after it changes, and carries production information between scenes
	ChangeSceneOnClick- put on mitochondria view reactionsets, changes the scene to the inspector assigned name
		also has function to return to the mitochondria view, used by the exit button in each reaction
	MouseWheelCameraZoom
	ArrowKeyCameraMove
	Tuple

		
Molecule Descriptions (Used in MoleculeView gui)
	Powersources
		Adenosine triphosphate [POWERSOURCE] a molecule that stores energy in 3 phosphate (P) bonds /// can lose one of its 3 phosphates (P) to a carbon chain, converting itself to ADP /// also the product of ADP + a phosphate
		Adenosine diphosphate [CONVERTED POWERSOURCE] a molecule with 2 phosphate bonds that results when ATP loses a phosphates /// can gain a phosphate from a carbon chain to turn back into ATP
		NADH [POWERSOURCE] a molecule used to store and carry high-energy electrons /// created from NAD+
		NAD+ [CONVERTED POWERSOURCE] a molecule that takes in electrons and free floating hydrogens to turn into NADH- /// releases free energy in this process
	Enzymes
		Kinase [ENZYME] a crucial enzyme that catalyzes the tranfer of a phosphate between ATP/ADP and a carbon chain 
		Dehydrogenase [ENZYME] adds a free phosphate to a carbon chain and converts NAD to NADH 
			CHANGE- adding electrons to NADH in the form of a hydrogen, by binding to NAD 
			NOTE- dehy does not add phosphate, another enzyme adds phosphate
		Aldolase [ENZYME] splits a carbon chain in two 
		Add isomerase
		Add question marks that explain things mechanics don't 
		Notes showing actual
		


New Level/Scene Todo
1. Drag in CarbonChain prefab and tag with MovingCarbonChain
2. Drag in all Reactions
3. Drag in all Intermediates, set molecules to spawn when the MovingCarbonChain passes in ChainChecker
4. Add ArrowKeyCameraMove to Main Camera
5. Drag in UICanvas 
6. Drag in PuzzleController, set the MovingCarbonChain as Inputmolecule and the initial molecules to spawn
