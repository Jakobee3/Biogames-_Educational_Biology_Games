# biogames-educationalgamedev
A project to design and create a series of biology teaching games to be offered for free on the web.
Began as an independent study at Hendrix College in Fall 2017 and continued since. 

POWERCELL is a puzzle game where players learn how cell respiration works by puzzling out the mechanism themselves. 

CLADOCAB has players driving a variety of organisms to their home locations in a time-proportional tree of life, teaching concepts of cladistics, evolution, and diversity in the process.
